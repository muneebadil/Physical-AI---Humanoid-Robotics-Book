# Glossary

## Embodied Cognition
The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the physical world. Intelligence emerges from the interplay between sensory input, motor output, and environmental interaction.

## Physical AI
Artificial intelligence systems that interact directly with the physical world through sensors and actuators, as opposed to purely digital AI systems.

## Sensorimotor Integration
The process by which sensory information and motor commands are combined to produce coordinated behavior in intelligent systems.

## Humanoid Robot
A robot with human-like form, typically featuring a head, torso, arms, and legs designed to operate in human environments.

## Zero Moment Point (ZMP)
A concept in robotics used to assess the stability of legged robots during locomotion. It represents a point where the net moment of the ground reaction forces is zero.

## Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study of interactions between humans and robots, focusing on design, development, and evaluation of robotic systems for human use.

## Proprioception
The sense of the relative position of one's body parts and strength of effort being employed in movement. In robotics, it refers to sensors that measure internal robot state.

## Actuator
A component responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. In robotics, actuators convert energy into physical motion.

## Control Architecture
The organizational structure of control systems in robotics, typically involving hierarchical layers for planning, behavior, and motor control.

## Autonomous System
A system that operates independently without continuous human guidance, making decisions based on its programming and environmental inputs.

## Locomotion
The ability to move from one place to another. In humanoid robotics, it refers to walking, running, or other forms of movement.

## Manipulation
The ability to purposefully handle or control objects in the environment, typically using robotic arms and hands.

## Perception System
The collection of sensors and algorithms that allow a robot to understand its environment, including vision, touch, and auditory systems.

## Compliance Control
A control method that allows robots to adapt their behavior based on contact forces, making interactions with humans and objects safer.

## Whole-Body Control
A control approach that considers the entire robot as a single system, coordinating multiple parts simultaneously for complex tasks.
